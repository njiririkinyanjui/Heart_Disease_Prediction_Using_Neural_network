# Heart_Disease_Prediction_Using_Neural_network
THE CONTEXT The Cleveland Heart Disease Database (CHDD) is considered the de facto database for heart disease research Age, sex, chest pain,resting blood presure, serum cholestoral, fasting blood sugar, resting electrocardiographic results, maximum heart rate achieved,exercise induced angina,ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest,the slope of the peak exercise ST segment, number of major vessels, and target are considered to be risk factors for heart disease, and hereditary risk factors such as high blood pressure and diabetes also lead to heart disease We want to classified if patients have heart disease or not according to features given in the dataset. We will try to use this data to create a model which tries predict if a patient has this disease or not. We will use implement various model(classification) algorithm but we want to see if Neutral Network will perform compare to other models.
